### Hello, my name is Antônio Venâncio, I'm 19 years old and I'm currently studying Internet Systems at UNIESP Centro Universitário! Since I was 08 years old, I have been fond of technology, which has become something present in my day-to-day life, where when I got home from school, I would run to the computer and open one of my favorite games, or I would watch some of the various youtubers of the time! I've always considered myself an extremely curious person, who, when I had the opportunity, didn't think about anything other than delving into research to find out why it worked that way, or what caused such a situation and so on, all in the utmost detail. . I dream of making a living from what has been with me for so long, from this passion for technology and for everything it has to offer me, and I am committed to it!
